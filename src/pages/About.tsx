            The first thing I built was a spreadsheet that had quietly become an app. Next came a
            Max for Live device because I wanted a delay I couldn&rsquo;t find. When a collection
            outgrew my notes app, I built the database I needed. That pattern stuck. I find the
            part that wastes time or gets in the way, learn the system around it, and make a
            practical fix.
          </p>

            I&rsquo;m a software developer who likes working on the whole application. I organize the
            data, connect the APIs, build the screens, and test it all in the browser. I like taking
            a fuzzy problem and making it concrete enough to try. Then I work through the awkward
            cases until the software behaves the way a person would expect.
